'Kalashnikov's Automatic Rifle Modernised') is an assault rifle designed by Soviet small arms designer Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1959. It is the most ubiquitous rifle of the Kalashnikov rifles. It was developed as a replacement to the AK-47 introduced a decade prior.\nIntroduced into service with the Soviet Army in 1959, the AKM is the most prevalent variant of the entire AK series of firearms and it has found widespread use with most member states of the former Warsaw Pact and its African and Asian allies as well as being widely exported and produced in many other countries. The production of these rifles was carried out at both the Tula Arms Plant and Izhmash. It was officially replaced in Soviet frontline service by the AK-74 in the late 1970s, but remains in use worldwide.\nThe AKM maintains the AK-47's wood stock, but has simpler individual parts that are favorable for mass production. Like the AK-47, many variants of the AKM exist such as the AKMS, AKML, and AKMP.",
